## Description
The **Netflix Random Movie Generator** is a web application that queries an API database ([Unogs](https://rapidapi.com/unogs/api/unogs)) of up-to-date Netflix movies and displays a randomly selected movie.

This project aims to make choosing a film from Netflix easier, by displaying one film at a time. This removes the issue of "too much choice" when scanning through the hundreds of available films on Netflix.

## Features
* search by Country
* search by recently added
* search by genre (or a generic "all genres" search)
* a "search again" button, repeating the last search
* movie information - title, synopsis, runtime, released, rating and image

## How To Use
1. Select a Country from the dropdown list and click "continue"
2. Choose your search parameters, by either clicking on the "recently added" tab, or the "genre" tab and selecting a genre from the dropdown list
3. Click "Search Netflix"
4. Either search again, or click "BACK" to change your search criteria (step 2)
5. If needed, click on the Country name to choose a different Country (step 1)
